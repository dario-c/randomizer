#Welcome to The Randomizer
A platform to share recommendations with other locals and rediscover your city

##Intro

The Randomizer was developed during 2 weeks as a final project for the development bootcamp IronHack, in Barcelona.

The Randomizer is a platform to...

- **Share:**
  - The Randomizer allows for people to share their recommendations such as bars, restaurants, museums, clubs and many more

- **Rediscover:**
  - The app presents each user with 5 random recommendations every day.  After 24h they will be able to see 5 new ones
    
    
##How does it work:

- Users are controlled by a Karma system which distinguishes in between 3 roles: Regular, Ambassadors and Badkarma.  
- Their interactions with the platform vary depending on their role

- Recommendations are controlled by a point system that makes recommendations with bad feedback to disappear

    
  ##Main tools used:

- Ruby on Rails (with Act as votable, Carriewave and Devise)

- Rspec with (Factory Girl)
